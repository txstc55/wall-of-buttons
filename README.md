# Wall of Buttons

I created this project because there are just too many god damn button styles.

You can view the project [here](https://txstc55.github.io/wall-of-buttons/).

If you want to add a new button style, either open a pull request or submit an issue and tell me to go to this link. Alternatively, just email me (it's not that hard to find my email)
